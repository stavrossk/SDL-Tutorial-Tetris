=head1 NAME

SDL::Tutorial::Tetris::Controller::CPUSpinner

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<CPUSpinner> controller is the heartbeat of the game.

The game proceeds while C<keep_going> is set. When C<CPUSpinner>
receives a C<Quit> event, C<keep_going> is set to zero.

=head2 init

C<init> simply initializes C<keep_going>, so the game will start.

=head2 run

Produces a C<Tick> event while C<keep_going> is set.

=head2 notify

If this controller receives a C<Quit> event, C<keep_going> is
set to zero, stopping the game.
